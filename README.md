The Onet Connect puzzle game at the core is remarkably simple. To play the game all you have to do is connect two tiles. To achieve this the player must press a starting tile and then the destination tile which has the same image as the starting one. However, to introduce a level of challenge the game incorporates the following rules â€“ to connect the tiles, there cannot be any obstacles between the selected and target tile. Additionally, a line which connects the tiles can only change its direction up to two times.
